## How to contribute to Zilswap Webapp

### **Do you intend to add your project's token logo?**

Please visit the [zilswap token list](https://github.com/Switcheo/zilswap-token-list) to add your token logo. This repository only hosts the Zilswap UI source code.

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the Zilswap UI or smart contract**, and instead to send an email to [security@switcheo.network](mailto:https://security@switcheo.network).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Switcheo/zilswap-webapp/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Switcheo/zilswap-webapp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Zilswap will generally not be accepted.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [zilswap discord channel](https://discord.gg/5n8AMQH) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you want to contribute to the Zilswap documentation or SDK?**
